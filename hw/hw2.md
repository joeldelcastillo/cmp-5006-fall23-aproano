### Homework 2

## Exercise 1:

1. Suppose a password is chosen as a concatenation of seven lower-case dictionary words. Each word is selected uniformly at random from a dictionary of size 50,000. An example of such a password is "mothercathousefivenextcrossroom". How many bits of entropy does this have?

2. Consider an alternative scheme where a password is chosen as a sequence of 10 random alphanumeric characters (including both lower-case and upper-case letters). An example is "dA3mG67Rrs". How many bits of entropy does this have?

3. Which password is better, the one from 1. or 2.?

## Exercise 2:

1. Design a data verification system using hash functions. Explain the steps involved in the process.
2. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using hash functions for data verification.
3. Provide an example of a real-world application where a data verification system using hash functions is used.

## Exercise 3:

1. Define what a Message Authentication Code (MAC) is and how it is used in cryptography.
2. Explain the process of generating and verifying a MAC.
3. Discuss the importance of using MACs in secure communication systems.

## Exercise 4:

Given the values of p = 17 and q = 23, generate a pair of keys for RSA.


## Exercise 5:

1. Design a public key infrastructure (PKI) system. Explain the components and their roles in the system.
2. Discuss the advantages and challenges of implementing a PKI system.
3. Provide an example of a real-world application where a PKI system is used.

## Exercise 6:

Design a system for digital signatures based on public-key cryptography. Explain the steps involved in the process and the role of each component.
